# Analyzing debit card overdrafts

A local bank sought to investigate whether low-income consumers overdrafted more frequently than middle- or upper-income consumers. In this analysis, I use *(a,b,0)* families and generalized linear models to investigate this hypothesis. "analyzing_overdrafts.R" explores using *(a,b,0)* families to model probability distributions as well as negative binomial GLM regressions to test for significant differences across income levels.
